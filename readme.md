Hi, this is a personal project "chrome/firefox extension" made for fun and to get a better user experience on the EPHEC's online platforms.

It improves the design aesthetics and user experience of the EPHEC's online platforms.

Features :
 - Enable filtering out unnecessary courses on Moodle.
 - Implement automatic actions such as the Moodle login.
 - Display your schedule directly upon logging into the ePerso's site.
 - Enable logo and color choice (old/new) by clicking on it.
